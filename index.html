            <h3> About Me </h3>
            <br>
            <p> Most of my academic career has been shaped by those around me. Specifically, I spent a considerable about of time in boarding school and university college meeting
                 a range of different people from across the globe. During this time I have been fortunate enough to learn how to communicate and coordinate with a large group of 
                 contrasting people. In addition to my interpersonal and communication abilities, I have a passion for technology and how it can be used to better our lives. This passion
                 is realized through the considerable amount of my free time I utilize to build personal projects and work within the community. Case studies and competitions are also an 
                 interest of mine. I am currently participating in the Microsoft Protege Competition and was a campus finalist for last year's Good Shepard Microfinance Case Competition.

                    <p> The GMCC provides students with an insight into the world of microfinance and consulting. The case competition was on a live project named 
                    LauchME, a low-interest small loan scheme for low-income
                    care workers who want to start a business.
                    <br> 
                    The role involved determining the location of a new base of operations for the program.
                    Using ABS census data I create an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRFzwzLUb1w">interactive map (click here)</a> of the target audience's location.
                    In addition, I created a product development strategy to increase funding, which we call the Bank and Established Business Incentive Scheme. 
                    See the slides to the right for more information.
                    <br>
                    Skills, such as communication, leadership, and creativity were all utilized in the process in creating this case.

                    <p> A personal project of mine which investigates the driving factors in predict where or not an individual earns above $50,000 annually in the US. 
                        The project determines that your captial gain or positive returns on investments, being married or in a civil parntership and individual's number 
                        of years in education are the main factors in determining income over and above $50,000 annually. Though there are some interesting interactions between
                        capital losses and age. Click the title of this section for more information.
                        <br>
                        The project makes use of a XGBoost classifier to construct the model, Permutation Importatance lists, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and 
                        summay plots to determine how each feature effects the model's prediction.

                <br>
                <p> Last year I was given the opportunity to raise $36,000 for Lady Lawley, a facility that offers respite care services for children and young adults with a wide 
                    range of multiple and complex medical needs. Together with three mates, we braved the 20km race with the hopes of raising some money for those in need, one of whom
                    is a close friend. The challenge involved displine in training, teamwork in the water and dedication to finish, and was an immensely rewarding experience.
